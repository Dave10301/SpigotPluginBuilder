This is a python tool to generate minecraft plugins. It does all the work, generating the code and compiling it into a jar file.
All code is executable through main.py and currently the jar outputs to Project/build/libs. Only works on Windows. Please note this is a base of an idea there is very few things it can actualy do. Might add more soon.
